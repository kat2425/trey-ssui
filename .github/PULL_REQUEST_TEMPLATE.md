## Why Clear Student's Data

We don't want a teacher to **EVER** see incorrect data. This could result into a lawsuit.

You need to clear Student's data before doing the following:

- If you are making an API request that returns Student's information
- Any data that is specific to one Student that you don't want to be viewed when a User selects a different Student.
